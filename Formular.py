"""Step-by-step example: Building a simple Tkinter form in Python.

This script demonstrates how to construct a graphical form using Tkinter
one step at a time. Each section is clearly separated so it can be followed
sequentially while learning how forms are assembled in Python.

The form collects a first name, last name, e-mail address, age and an optional
comment. Whenever the user presses the submit button the inputs are validated
and the data is summarised in a pop-up window.

-------------------------
How to read this example
-------------------------
Every function in this file contains detailed comments that explain what the
code is doing *and why it is done that way*. The idea is to treat the file like
an interactive tutorial:

1. Import the required modules.
2. Define a :class:`dataclass` to hold the submitted form data.
3. Create the main application window.
4. Add form fields (labels + entry widgets).
5. Add a multi-line text widget for free-form comments.
6. Wire up validation and submission logic.
7. Provide feedback to the user after submission.
8. Run the Tkinter event loop.

------------------------
How to show the form window
------------------------
1. Make sure Python 3.10+ is installed. On Windows you can verify this by
   running ``py --version`` in *PowerShell*, on macOS/Linux use
   ``python3 --version``.
2. Open a terminal inside the folder that contains this file.
3. Execute ``python Formular.py`` (or ``python3 Formular.py`` depending on the
   operating system). Tkinter will open a new window titled
   "Schritt-f端r-Schritt Formular".
4. Keep the editor side-by-side with the application window. When you trigger
   the buttons you can follow along in the source code to see which functions
   are executed.
